# Network-Traffic-Analysis
## What is this project about?
In this activity provided by Google Cybersecurity Certifications Program, I wrote up an incident report identifying the issues with a website using a network traffic analysis tool called tcpdump.

## Did I have to install anything?
I used Google Docs (see links to activity tasks below) to fill out the activities provided so there was no installations required.

## What did I learn?
I learnt DNS servers, ports for the specific DNS server and how to write up a report for an incident.
